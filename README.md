Deep Learning Framework Test -- Memory Layout

Cuda-convnet and cudnn use different memory layouts. 
In this repository, we compare the speed of inference according to the memory layout in CNN. 
The idea was referenced in a paper on optimizing memory efficiency for Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on GPUs written by Chao Li et al.
